# ProGo Base
ProGo Base is WordPress, Underscores, Bootstrap, Theme Hook Alliance, get-out-the-way-lemme-do-it all-in-one "Theme Framework".

Useful as a Base theme, stand-alone, starting point to fork and rename and build on, or a combination of any ideas.

Built by ProGo, a collection of Developers and Designers and Marketers working together to create a pure foundation that we could use, with hopes that others might find it useful as well.
